Sinatra Flat Text Blog
----------------------

An attempt to create a simple blog software that can be plugged into an
existing Sinatra application. Uses flat text files instead of a database, like
jekyll (http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) does.

Work in progress and far from being ready for production.
